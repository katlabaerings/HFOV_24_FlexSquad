The following user stories were not implemented:

US9: As a manager I want to see analytics about sign-ups and cancellations so I can take better actions in order to keep them

US10: As a trainer I want to know which of classes are the most popular so I can add more time slots

We decided not to implement those two due to complexity and poor vision in the beginning. 
Upon further inspection of the user stories, we found them a little too complicated considering the whole of the project. 
We also acknowledge that our priority categorisation was a bit off since both of these user stories we skipped were categorised 
as P1 (2 out of 3).
