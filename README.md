## Information about Sprint 1
We implemented the following User Stories as independent functions:
- US1: As a gym member I want to be able to see available classes so i can plan what class i want to attend
- US2: As a gym member, I want to be able to attend virtual classes, so I can keep working on my health and well-being, even though I can’t physically be there
- US3: As a gym member I want more flexible subscription plans, such as one month or a single class, so that I can easily find the best subscription that suits me
- US4: As a fitness instructor I want to see how many members are attending my class so that I can be better prepared for each class
- US5: As a manager I want an overview of class attendance to understand class popularity

We interpreted that we could implement the User Stories independently but durning the feedback season with Shalini, we were corrected and got information that the program should run as one unit.

So therefore, in Sprint 2 we had to connect all the independant functions of each user story to the one unit program (UI).
